[freshbooks-cli](https://github.com/logankoester/freshbooks-cli) is a
command-line interface to the [FreshBooks](http://freshbooks.com/) API.

`freshbooks-create-plugin` implements the `create-plugin` subcommand for
[freshbooks-cli](https://github.com/logankoester/freshbooks-cli).

It also happens to be a generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io), though
it does not follow the generator-\_ naming convention.

`freshbooks-create-plugin` runs interactively. It will ask you to answer some
questions about the plugin you are creating, and then generate the necessary
files in the current directory.
